# Spotify Clone

![Spotify Clone Screenshot](./src/images/Screenshot.png)

This project is a work-in-progress Spotify clone, built using React. The goal of this project is to showcase my skills as a developer and create a replica of the popular music streaming platform, Spotify, with as close to 1:1 functionality as possible.

Please note that this project is currently under development, and not all features are fully implemented. I am actively working on enhancing the functionality and adding new features to make the clone as close to the original Spotify as possible.
